Canadian Alliance for Healthy Hearts and Minds,Canadian Alliance for Healthy Hearts and Minds,13,Population Health,"Cardiac, vascular, and cognitive dysfunction have a strong impact on the quality of life, longevity and health care costs, in Canada and globally. It is of paramount importance to understand the early determinants of such dysfunction and its progression to clinical events, especially given the increasing prevalence of known cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, which result in organ dysfunction including atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure and dementia, threatening the financial sustainability of health care systems.
Furthermore, two important knowledge gaps remain:
First, the â€œcauses of the causesâ€, specifically the influence of contextual factors such as environmental conditions on risk factors are not well understood. Their precise characterization in communities across Canada will aid policy development and inform population health interventions aimed at reducing the risk for cardiac, vascular and cognitive dysfunction.
Second, there is a lack of sensitive predictors and markers for early, subclinical stages on a systematic (blood) or regional (tissue) level.
The Canadian Parternership Against Cancer (CPAC) has requested proposals to build in cardiovascular phenoytping into their Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project (CPTP) cohorts from British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada. Our research team has proposed to build on the existing strengths of and closely collaborate with and leveraging established Canadian cohorts, i.e. the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), the Prospective Urban Rural Evaluation (PURE), and the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI) biobank, and to additionally recruit 2,000 Reserve-based Indigenous peoples from across Canada who are a high-risk group for CVD and cancer.
The objectives of the Alliance are:

To understand the role of socio-environmental and health system contextual factors (societal structure, built environment, nutrition environment, tobacco environment, access to and quality of health services) on individual CV risk factors, subclinical vascular disease, and clinical CV events.
 To identify early markers for sub-clinical dysfunction in the brain, heart and abdomen using magnetic resonance imaging, and to investigate the contextual and individual level determinants (i.e. biologic factors such as genetic and molecular signatures) of this dysfunction, as well as to assess the predictive value of sub-clinical dysfunction on the development of clinical CV events.

This includes blood pressure, anthropometrics, lipids, diabetes assessment, health behaviorsâ€™ including dietary assessment, physical fitness and smoking, social factors, mental health assessment, and measures of cognitive function, plus biologics (including DNA, urine and serum blood samples).
MRI Scan at Baseline: In a standardized, comprehensive and cost-efficient multi-parametric MRI scan will be attempted in all subjects. This includes the brain (ischemic white matter disease, covert strokes, cerebral atrophy and cerebral connectivity), heart (morphology, volumes and mass, global and regional wall motion, pericardial fat, covert myocardial infarction, non-ischemic fibrosis, infiltration, perfusion and oxygenation), blood vessels (plaque volume) and abdomen (visceral adipose tissue and liver fat). The proposed MRI protocol that combines several techniques in a single scan is efficient and tolerable.

Data from Local Health Integrated Network (LHIN) IV show that, in low-risk outpatients, the proportion of invasive angiograms without significant CAD is approximately 70%. Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography (CCTA) is a non-invasive test that is highly accurate for the detection of significant CAD in select populations and may be better suited for assessment of these low-risk patients. We propose to use our LHIN wide central triage for invasive angiography to identify such low-risk patients and direct them to CCTA as a first step.

CEASE - VT,Catheter Ablation Versus Amiodarone for Shock Prophylaxis in Defibrillator Patients with Ventricular Tachycardia,5,Arrhythmia,"To determine if Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) provide a shock or pacing therapy to bring back a normal heart beat when a patient experiences a dangerous abnormal heart rhythm such as ventricular tachycardia (VT).  ICDs are very successful in bringing back a normal heart beat when VT occurs, but they do not prevent further dangerous heart rhythms from occurring.  This study is designed to determine the best way to manage patients who have an ICD and who continue to have episodes of VT.  There are two methods for treatment the VT: 1) Ablation, and 2) Medication.  An ablation procedure involves placing a flexible catheter (insulated wire) in the groin area and threading it into the heart.  After the doctor has located the affected area responsible for the VT, radiofrequency energy is delivered by the power generator through the catheter to the inside of the heart.  The radiofrequency energy ablates (burns) a small area of the heart tissue thought to cause the VT.  A medication called Amiodarone is an ""anti-arrhythmic"" prescribed to prevent abnormal heart rhythms from recurring.  The purpose of this study is to compare these two different methods for treating VT.  Treatment with ablation and amiodarone are both considered the standard of care for patients with VT but they have not been compared directly in a study like this before.

DESI-GDM Digital,"Development of a digital health platform to track glucose, diet, and physical activity to prevent gestational diabetes in high-risk South Asian women (DESI-GDM Digital)",13,Population Health,"What is the proposed study? The proposed study will develop and pilot test an integrated DHP to deliver diet and exercise advice, and collect diet, exercise, and glucose data, to prevent dysglycemia in high-risk pregnant SA women residing in Peel. In consultation with physicians, dietitians, participants, behavioural psychologists, nurses, and digital health experts, we will:
A. Develop a motivational and reminder text messaging sequence for pregnant SA women that will provide information and bi-directional feedback to support healthy lifestyle choices aimed at preventing the development of GDM.
B. Develop an integrated ?one-stop? digital platform (such as a smartphone or computer-accessible app) to allow pregnant women to track blood glucose, activity, and diet by: 
i. tracking daily blood glucose readings (linked with Libre Freestyle).
ii. tracking daily activity, measured as number of steps taken (linked with FitBit Flex)
iii. tracking dietary intake (linked with MyFitnessPal + food photographs) 
C. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the individual tools and integrated platform through focus group feedback. 
Study design and methods
Study design: The study will consist of four major phases: 1) developing the personalized messages; 2) development of the text messaging system and integrated DHP; 3) a 2-week trial of the health messaging, tracking apps (Freestyle Libre, Fitbit Flex, MyFitnessPal), and integrated DHP; 4) focus groups with participants. 

Eligibility: Eligibility criteria match those of a planned trial to ensure transferability of the results of this pilot test to the trial (see Appendix A). 
Phase 1 (Quarter 1): Developing the personalized messages. Brief messages will be developed for transmission via text message or e-mail (method of delivery and time chosen by the participant), geared to motivate participants to make and stick with positive changes in diet and walking habit. The starting point for the messages will be those messages developed and successfully tested in the SAHARA digital health project27,28 (see Appendix A for samples), which will be modified for pregnancy with input from investigators trained in dietetics (de Souza), kinesiology (Lear), health coaching (Sherifali), behavioural psychology (Ritvo), and internal medicine (Anand). Messages will provide advice and support regarding reduction of refined carbohydrates, energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods (i.e. fried, fast foods, sugary beverages, and desserts), and advocate increased consumption of fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes. Physical activity messages will be aimed at increased at decreasing sedentary behaviour and increasing walking. All health messages will be tailored to pregnancy. Focus groups will be convened with women to review and refine the messages developed by the team to ensure they are understandable and resonate with the target population. Messages are modified based on feedback from participants prior to use in Phase 3 of the study (below).
Phase 2 (Quarter 2): Development of the text messaging system and integrated DHP. This phase will involve setting up the bidirectional text message/e-mail delivery system, based on the platform used for SAHARA, and working with data integration team members Bangdiwala and Scott to develop the integrated ?one-stop? DHP to test in the study.
Phase 3 (Quarter 2-3): Pilot trial of the health messaging and tracking apps. 
Recruitment for Phase 3: Participants are referred by primary care physicians, obstetricians & gynecologists in hospital clinics, general practices, prenatal classes, and community centres in the Peel Region (ON), where SA account for 20.9% of the population29. This strategy has successfully recruited>1,000 pregnant SA women into START (see Appendix A for details). 
Design of Phase 3: In this phase, we will develop a digital platform that integrates data received from the 3 devices, visible through a central portal, eliminating the need for 3 or more separate apps. Twenty participants will use the DHP for 2 weeks. Text/e-mail messages developed in phases 1 and 2 will be sent to participants at their preferred times. During the 2 week pilot, women wear the Freestyle Libre, Fitbit Flex, and log food using MyFitnessPal [MFP]). Data will be accessible by both the study team and the participants. These devices are chosen for their validity and acceptability (see Appendix A for details). 
Phase 4 (Quarter 3-4): Focus groups with participants. We will conduct 4 focus groups with 5 participants each. Focus groups will be audio-recorded and transcribed and members of the research team with expertise in qualitative research will interpret the findings (Sherifali, Ritvo, Lear, Wahi). Coding and analyses will be performed using Nvivo (v. 10; QSR International) employing a thematic analytic approach (see Appendix A for details).30,31 

Outcomes: The process outcome measures of the pilot study assess the feasibility of the DHP, defined by: 1) success at transmitting health messages via electronic media (text messaging and e-mail), 2) success at participants wearing the Libre Freestyle (at least 10 days of data), FitBit (at least 10 days of wear) and engaging with MFP (at least 6 days logged), as this reflects the uptake of the intervention and helps to assess the effect of intervention on health behaviors, and 3) successful development of the integrated platform. If >90% of electronic communications are sent and acknowledged by participants and ?16 participants, are able to provide at least 10 days? of glucose data, wear the FitBit for ?10 days, and track food for ?6 days (out of 14 days), and the platform successfully integrates the 3 data sources (i.e. simultaneous track of glucose, activity, and diet at a single portal or app), we will consider the digital intervention feasible to use in our trial. Unmet targets will be used by the study team to understand the reasons for the failure, and to develop plans to mitigate in the full scale trial.

DIAGNOSE CRDS,Evaluation of a Novel Diagnostic Test for Calcium Release Deficiency Syndrome,5,Arrhythmia,"The RyR2 gene encodes the RyR2 calcium channel, a protein that regulates calcium flow in the heart. RyR2 genetic changes that lead to reduced function have been found to cause a new condition called Calcium Release Deficiency Syndrome (CRDS). CRDS patients are vulnerable to dangerous electrical heart rhythms that can cause cardiac arrest and death. At present, there is no clinical testing method that identifies CRDS patients (all conventional testing is normal) and its diagnosis requires special testing in a research laboratory. Delays for this testing and it not being available to most clinicians/patients have resulted in an urgent need to identify a clinical diagnostic test. Our team of clinical and basic science researchers believe we have identified a method to diagnose CRDS patients. We previously reported a family with a genetic change in RyR2 wherein affected individuals developed marked QT interval prolongation (a measurement on electrical heart tracings) in response to the heart being paced. Following research testing on the genetic change, we discovered that the family suffered from CRDS. We then proceeded to do this testing in a limited number of CRDS patients and we observed the same finding. We now propose to explore the ability of this test to identify CRDS in a rigorous manner by performing it in a large number of CRDS patients, patients with other heart conditions, and healthy individuals. We hope to prove that the test is reliably positive in CRDS patients and reliably negative in the other groups tested.

DREAM ON,Diabetes REduction Assessment with ramipril and rosiglitazone Medication Ongoing evaluatioN,3,Diabetes,"""To show that rosiglitazone substantially reduced the risk of diabetes and increased regression to normoglycemia in people with either impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance. The 2 month washout suggested that there was durability of this effect after stopping rosiglitazone; however this may have been influenced by the long half-life of rosiglitazone.
Clear evidence within the DREAM trial that rosiglitazone increased hip circumference and reduced the waist/hip ratio and ALT levels, and animal data suggesting that rosiglitazone may preserve beta cell mass and function suggests that the median 3 years of exposure to rosiglitazone in DREAM may have an even longer-term effect on the prevention of diabetes and its consequences. Such an effect would be detectable by further open follow-up of the DREAM cohort and will be assessed in the passive DREAM ON follow-up study.
The DREAM trial also showed that ramipril clearly increased regression to normoglycemia by 17%, and reported a nonsignificant 9% reduction in diabetes incidence. Whether or not the effect on regression means that longer treatment and follow-up would detect an effect on diabetes prevention remains unknown. This possibility will also be assessed in the DREAM ON study.""

EVAR ,Major Cardiovascular complications in patients undergoing EndVascular Aneurysm Repair,9,Perioperative,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are frequent in older population and if left untreated, are at increased risk of life-threatening rupture. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a minimally-invasive procedure often performed as an alternative to open surgical repair. EVAR is associated with less postoperative complications, and patients are frequently discharged in the first 24 hours after the intervention. However, EVAR is not associated with a long-term mortality advantage over open repair. Early cardiac complications occurring after patient discharge that may be undetected might explain the long-term prognostic difference. The EVAR Study is a multicenter prospective cohort study which will assess major cardiovascular complications in patients undergoing EVAR. Patients will have troponins measured in the first 3 postoperative days and will be followed for 30 days post-surgery.

For the pilot phase: the primary objective is to determine the feasibility of obtaining at least one troponin (Tn) measurement at day 2 or day 3 after surgery in â‰¥ 75% of enrolled patients whether they are home or in the hospital.

Guyana Prospective Observation Study for CVD Risk Assessment and Treatment by Non-Physician Health Workers,Guyana Prospective Observation Study for CVD Risk Assessment and Treatment by Non-Physician Health Workers,13,Population Health,"Rationale:
Cardiovascular disease is one of the most common causes of death in Guyana. Risk factors such as smoking, diabetes and hypertension need to be screened and managed early. Due to a lack of physicians in Guyana, clinicians have little time to screen, identify and fully address CVD and its risk factors. The WHO framework for task shifting and redistributing specific tasks to non-physician health workers (NPHWs) provides a potential solution to this problem.  This study protocol intends to implement an evidence-based programme for NPHWs to screen, identify and manage individuals with CVD and its risk factors.
Objectives:
1) To develop, implement and evaluate a programme for screening and managing CVD and its risk factors using up-to-date evidence and guideline recommendations in Guyana
2) To evaluate the feasibility of using NPHWs as the primary point of contact
3) To assess the feasibility of performing larger-scale epidemiological and health intervention studies in Guyana
Study Design:
This is a pilot observational, prospective follow-up study to be conducted at a single centre. This design is the best method to address the study objectives as it will allow for prospective data collection, while assessing the feasibility of conducting a study using a pragmatic evidence-based programme centred around NPHWs.
Study Population:
The study will prospectively recruit family members and friends of patients and staff at the Doobay Medical and Research Centre. These individuals are selected for this study for practical reasons. Participants would be 18 years of age or older. The following population will be excluded from the study: 1) refusal to consent, 2) actively involved in any study or heart health program that would compromise the study protocol, 3)severe co-morbid condition including dialysis with life expectancy < 1 year, or 4) other serious condition(s) or logistic factors likely to interfere with study participation or with the ability to complete the trial
Methods:
The study participants will be approached to consent for the study. Once their consent is obtained, participants will be interviewed, examined and screened for cardiovascular risk factors by NPHWs using an evidence-based algorithm. Based on this algorithm, NPHWs will provide lifestyle modification counselling. Initiating or adjusting pharmacotherapy will be supervised by local physicians based on international guidelines. Follow-up appointments will occur at 3, 6 and 12 months. Participants will be reassessed and their management plans will be modified accordingly. At 12 months, participants will be asked to provide feedback on their experience.
Primary Outcomes:
1) Qualitative feedback from participants, NPHWs, and supervising physicians
2) Participant recruitment and retention into the program as assessed by the rate of consent, and completion of follow-up visits at 3, 6 and 12 months
3) Adherence to intervention as assessed by the participant?s continued use of the recommended intervention for CVD and its risk factors.
Secondary Outcomes:
1. Change in LDL/HDL, triglyceride and total cholesterol from baseline to 12 months
2. Change in BP from baseline to 12 months
3. Proportion of participants with well-controlled blood pressure at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months (SBP<140 mmHg in non-diabetic individuals, SBP<130 mmHg in diabetic individuals)

INTERHEART,INTERHEART a global study of risk factors for acute myocardial infarction,13,Population Health,"The INTERHEART study found that nine easily measurable and modifiable risk factors could explain over 90 per cent of the risk of a heart attack globally and in all regions and major ethnic groups of the world. These studies emphasized that avoidance of tobacco, daily consumption of fruits and vegetables and regular exercise could potentially avoid two-thirds of heart disease. The results also indicated that tobacco (smoking even one cigarette per day increases the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) by five per cent) and abnormal lipids were the two most important risk factors globally, and that the markers of abdominal obesity and hip size (waist-to-hip-ratio) are far more predictive than body mass index (BMI) in predicting MI. Furthermore, stress and psychosocial factors were found to be important risk factors for MI.

AnÂ effective global strategy to reduce the risk of premature stroke mandates systematic evaluation of the contribution of important risk factors in various ethnic groups and geographical locations. The overwhelming success of INTERHEART has afforded enormous insights into our knowledge of risk factors for myocardial infarction [MI] in different regions of the world and among different ethnic groups. As a result, it has armed public health policy makers with critical information to develop population-based approaches to prevent MI. Similar data are needed to help in the prevention of stroke.

ISLAND-ACS,Interventions to Support Long-term adherence aNd Decrease cardiovascular events post  Myocardial Infarction,15,Knowledge Translation,"For patients who have had a myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery disease, guidelines recommend cardiac rehabilitation services and the long‐term use of cardiac medications to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. These treatments are proven to improve quality of life and reduce the risk of repeat heart attacks or death amongst persons who have already had one heart attack. However, research shows that many people who have had a heart attack do not stick with these treatments and therefore cannot benefit from them. The ISLAND study is a quality improvement research program that seeks to understand the impact of low-cost interventions that could be readily implemented at scale by entire health systems or organizations wishing to improve adherence to proven treatments. Specifically, the trial will test whether providing Ontario‐based patients (and their health professionals) with repeated educational reminders delivered via post and phone will help improve the medication adherence and attendance at cardiac rehabilitation.",Publication,Interventional - Procedure,2015,2017,Women's College Hospital,,1,18,4590

LiGHT Trial,Living Green and Healthy for Teens (LiGHT) ? a randomized trial evaluating behaviour change using a healthy living app for youth and their families,13,Population Health,"Background:
Obesity and associated cardiovascular risk factors are highly prevalent in youth and are associated with early morbidity and mortality. Changing health behaviours is effective in reducing risk factors, but challenging to implement. The Living Green and Healthy for Teens (LiGHT) app has been rigorously developed as an evidence-based, user-friendly, stakeholder-reviewed tool to facilitate healthy behaviour change.

Research Questions
Primary Research Question
Among youth aged 10-16 years, does randomization of their family to the use of the interactive gamified Living Green and Healthy for Teens (LiGHT) app over a 1 year period, compared to a simple listing of healthy lifestyle information websites, increase the proportion of youth engaging in a composite of healthy active living behaviours?

Secondary Research Questions
Does the LiGHT app: 
a) prevent an increase in BMI z-score at 1 year; 
b) increase time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity at 1 year; and 
c) improve diet quality at 1 year?

Methods and expertise:
Using a single-centre randomized, parallel, controlled single-blind design, 250 eligible youth-parent dyads will be allocated 1:1 to received: a) the LiGHT app system; or b) a list of links to websites providing information and tips on healthy eating and activity. They will be followed for 1 year.  All families with at least one smart phone will be eligible. App usage will be monitored electronically. Visits at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year will evaluate questionnaires on food frequency, breakfast intake, and screen and sleep time, as well as 1 week accelerometry data to quantify moderate and vigorous physical activity and sedentary time. The cohort from which many of the youth and parents will be drawn has already demonstrated a commitment to long-term follow-up. The team is composed of individuals from McMaster University and the Childhood Obesity Foundation, who respectively have expertise in: recruitment, retention and high quality data collection among cohorts of youth, as well as successful completion of large randomized trials; and development, evaluation and community-based implementation of behavioural interventions including electronic tools for obesity treatment and prevention in partnership with industry and government.   

Expected outcomes:
Many health apps are either not developed based on evidence or are not engaging for users, and very few are studied systematically for their effectiveness in improving health, especially among youth. This trial will evaluate the fairly long-term use of an app that has been developed in Canada based on sound behavioural psychology, scientific evidence regarding behaviours relevant to cardiovascular health, and interactive, engaging technology. It further encourages family engagement and multiple motivators which are important for youth. We will learn whether a properly designed app can affect healthy behaviour change at a critical life stage, over a sustained period of time. If effective, wide dissemination on a population scale through simple electronic channels will facilitate improved cardiovascular risk profiles for any family with access to a smartphone.

OASIS Registry,OASIS (Organization to Assess Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes),7,Acute Coronary Syndromes,"To evaluate the variations between countries in invasive cardiac procedures and outcomes in patients with suspected unstable angina or myocardial infarction without initial ST elevation. Significant differences between countries were observed.  The study concluded that higher rates of invasive and revascularisation procedures were associated with lower rates of refractory angina or readmission for unstable angina, no apparent reduction in cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction, but with higher rates of stroke and suggested that randomised trials should assess the relative impact of conservative and more aggressive approaches to invasive cardiac procedures and revascularisations in patients with unstable angina.

Data on clinical variables, procedures, and events were collected prospectively during the patient's stay in hospital by means of standard forms. Data on transfers from one hospital to another for a procedure were also recorded. At 6 months, data were collected on all interim procedures, occurrence of myocardial infarction, readmission for unstable angina, and death. Events were not adjudicated.

PACT-HF,Patient-Centered Care Transitions in Heart Failure (PACT-HF): A pragmatic multi-center cluster randomized trial,16,Heart Failure,"We used a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomized design to introduce PACT-HF across 10 large hospitals in our publicly funded health care system.
The goal was for all patients hospitalized with HF to receive self-care education, multidisciplinary care services, and early follow-up with their primary health care providers; and for high-risk patients to receive nurse-led home visits and outpatient care in Heart Function clinics following hospital discharge.
We redesigned workflow to integrate health care services across institutions and regional networks that typically work independently of each other.
We obtained clinical outcomes via linkages to provincial administrative databases, analyzing them using shared frailty survival models adjusted for the stepped wedge design.
We analyzed secondary outcomes using hierarchical models adjusted for the stepped wedge design. We applied the Intention-to-treat principle for all analyses.

Primary outcomes are:
 Time to 3-month composite all-cause readmissions, emergency department (ED) visits, and death.
 30-day composite all-cause readmissions and ED visits.
Secondary outcomes are patient-reported Discharge Preparedness, Care Transitions Quality, Health Related Quality of Life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years.

PADIT Cluster Crossover,Prevention of Arrhythmia Device Infection Trial (PADIT) Cluster Crossover Study,17,Cardiac Surgery,"To reduce infection after pacemaker or ICD surgery, antibiotics are used but the ideal amount and duration is unknown. Many different antibiotic strategies are used in Canada but no comparative effectiveness studies have been performed. We do not know if the standard single dose of intravenous antibiotic is enough or if extra doses of different antibiotics before, during and after surgery help to reduce infection. Pacemaker and ICD procedures are delivered at high volume specialized centres following Standard Operating Procedures. Because of this systemization of care, comparative effectiveness testing to improve care should be tested in the systems in which they will be used. PADIT will test whether single antibiotics or additional antibiotics reduce infection best by randomizing centres, not patients, to one antibiotic strategy or another. Centres will be randomized to one therapy and then cross over to the next after 6 months. At one year they will randomize again and then cross over for a final time at 18 months. All patients at the centre receiving a pacemaker of ICD will receive that strategy during the study.

Risk Factors for Sub-optimal Dialysis Initiation,Risk Factors for Sub-optimal Dialysis Initiation,1,Renal,"At the end of 2014, 20,690 Canadians were receiving chronic dialysis. Unfortunately, many of these patients started dialysis sub-optimally. There are various definitions for a sub-optimal dialysis start, but most include the criteria of dialysis initiation during a hospitalization and/or with a central venous catheter (CVC). Patients with a sub-optimal dialysis start have increased morbidity and mortality. As well, patients who start dialysis without appropriate preparation have likely been denied the opportunity to make an informed decision with respect to their end stage renal disease (ESRD) care. There is also the important consideration of cost. It is estimated that preventing one sub-optimal dialysis start could save the Canadian Healthcare System $20,275 in hospital costs.The first step towards reducing the incidence of sub-optimal dialysis initiation is to identify important risk factors. Our study will be the first to prospectively examine actionable and modifiable risk factors for sub-optimal dialysis initiation among patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) followed in multi-care kidney clinics (MCKC). MCKCs are multi-disciplinary clinics wherein patients are prepared for renal replacement therapy (RRT).

To determine if reduced health literacy (HL) is associated with an increased risk of hospitalizations, medication non-adherence, and patient related delayed decision-making with respect to RRT preparationTo determine patient perspectives regarding RRT preparation. The results will help inform the design of a multi-faceted intervention to be tested in a cluster randomized clinical trial with the ultimate aim of reducing the incidence of sub-optimal dialysis starts

These veins themselves can block over time. This may result in part simply from the trauma from the surgery, in other words, by removing the vein from the leg and then sewing it to the heart. Another mechanism may be the abnormal metabolic processes within the body responsible for the plaque build-up of the heart arteries in the first place - this may lead to the blockages of the veins used for bypass. In the present era of heart bypass surgery, this incidence of veins blocking remains high despite advances in blood thinners and cholesterol medications. This study is designed to determine whether two new interventions may potentially reduce the incidence of blockages in the veins used for heart bypass surgery. One is a surgical technique significantly reducing the trauma associated with removing the leg vein prior to use as a bypass graft onto the heart. The second intervention is the use of a nutritional supplement before and after surgery which is composed of fish oils. The study will recruit sufficient patients to provide strong and relevant conclusions regarding both study questions. It will be highly applicable also because it will include approximately 1,550 patients from approximately 50 hospitals across many countries. We believe these techniques will result in significantly less vein blockages in patients one year after heart bypass surgery.

Primary Outcome Surgical Arm: Proportion of study SVGs (â€œno touchâ€ versus conventionally harvested) which are totally (100%) occluded on cardiac CT angiography at 1-year post-CABG and death due to cardiovascular or unknown causes. Pharmacological Arm: Proportion of patients with greater than or equal to 1 graft (saphenous or arterial) totally (100%) occluded on cardiac CT angiography at 1-year post-CABG and death due to cardiovascular or unknown causes, comparing the fish-oil to placebo groups.

TADA Study - The Treatment with APO-Dabigatran Analysis Study,Impact of Rabeprazole-induced Elevated Gastric pH on APO-Dabigatran exposure in healthy volunteers,8,CVD Prevention,"Background: Optimization of the formulation of Pradaxa® (Dabigatran etexilate) provides consistent absorption in patients, independent of gastric pH. This has been demonstrated in clinical trials, where clinical outcomes with and without proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were evaluated and shown to be equivalent. Many patients taking oral anticoagulants are elderly and have an increased gastric pH, often through commonly prescribed comedications such as PPIs. Generic formulations of dabigatran etexilate are required to demonstrate bioequivalence (BE) to the originator in young healthy volunteers to receive regulatory approval in Canada. One generic currently on the market in Canada is produced by Apotex Inc. (APO-Dabigatran). Apotex Inc. have changed the acid in the tablet from tartaric to fumaric. They were, however, not required to demonstrate the same BE in those with an altered gastric pH such as older patients or on comedications (e.g. PPIs).  
Objective: To determine any influence of PPIs on absorption of generic dabigatran available in Canada.
Methodology: Healthy male volunteers will participate in the study. All procedures performed will be done in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and according to the declaration of Helsinki. All participants will provide written informed consent. 
APO-dabigatran will be used for an open, cross-over design in up to 50 volunteers who will receive a single dose of 150 mg. Blood samples will be taken at defined time points: 0/trough, 30, 60, and 90 min and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Volunteers will then undergo a wash-out period (4 days) while taking a PPI once daily (rabeprazole). On day 5, a repeat single APO-dabigatran 150 mg tablet will be administered in addition to the PPI. Blood sampling will occur as performed previously.
Assessment and Endpoints: Dabigatran levels for APO-dabigatran (total and active metabolite) will be the assessment for the area under the concentration–time curve from baseline to the last quantifiable data point (AUC0–tz), and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of total, with or without PPI. Secondary outcomes include dabigatran-specific assays such as diluted thrombin time (dTT) and aPTT. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by: frequency of AEs and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate).

TIMING,Timing of second dose of SARS-CoV2- mRNA vaccine on Immunologic and Neutralizing Antibody Responses Generated in Healthcare workers: a real world study,4,Infectious Diseases,"The problem being addressed: As of January 2021, a marked and unexpected reduction in the supply of the mRNA vaccines to Canada has led to a policy change of delaying the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine to healthcare workers (HCW) up to 35 to 42 days. There is little evidence to support this policy, which could be harmful if immunity diminishes to low levels, leaving HCWs at risk of infection before the delayed second dose. Furthermore, there is no data to inform how dosing schedules may impact on the secondary immune responses and long term immunity. However, this policy represents a potential natural experiment and an opportunity to study the impact of dosing schedule on vaccine immunogenicity as it relates to short and long term immunity. Since the sequence and timing interval of dosing to HCWs are largely randomly generated; the variation in time interval between the first and second vaccine doses is unbiased and unaffected by any factors other than by chance. 

Questions: We therefore propose an opportunistic study in which we will study and address the following questions: (1) What are the cellular immune responses and humoral responses to the first dose of mRNA vaccine up to 42 days and following the second dose up to 12 months. (2) How does the dosing schedule impact on the secondary immune responses and long term immunity. The study will be conducted in HCWs, a high risk group across 3 tertiary hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. 

Objectives: 
Primary Objectives
1. Examine the NAb levels and cellular immune responses at days 35-42 compared to day 21 following the first dose of mRNA vaccine.  
2. Characterize the profile of NAb and cellular immune responses following the first dose of vaccine up to 42 days and following the second dose up to 12 months
3. Contrast the profiles of NAb and cellular immune responses between 21-day dosing interval (correct cohort) versus delayed 35-42 day dosing (delayed cohort) interval of vaccine.
Secondary Objective. 
The secondary objective will be exploratory as the study is not powered to examine this objective. The findings will help to guide the planning of a larger study to address this particularly question. 
1. To explore the threshold levels for NAbs and cellular immunity associated with significant reduction in infection risk of symptomatic SARS-CoV2 infection
